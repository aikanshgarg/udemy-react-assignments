- JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. 
	* It converts components to JS syntax by using the import React and it's createElement() method. 
	* ReactJS component names must begin with capital letters

- React has a VIRTUAL DOM which it compares with current dom to see what should it render, compares present with future.

- We can't write block statements like if-else in rendering the elements to DOM in JSX. Use ternary( ? : ) operator instead. 

- 1 root element(div) is required to be wrapped around in return() statement of rendering JSX

- Rendering Lists: map() method is used to render a list for mapping a JS array with JSX elements array, and render them accordingly.
  'key' is required property of list items in React.

- 'Radium': to use CSS properties like pseduo selectors (:hover) and media queries inside .js files(JSX)
   Useful for dynamically changing styles or scoping them to a particular component
   'StyleRoot' component for using transformation selectors like media query and keyframes

- CSS Modules: https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/   https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet

- ErrorBoundary => show custom error messages to user on production side if there's some thing which might fail

- 'useEffect' takes a fn which executes at every render cycle (runs for every update) 
   second arguments: 
   					[] -> empty array -> runs fn only when component is unmounted(deleted) or rendered for first time
   					no arguments -> run each time something is rendered

- Always make a copy of the original object or array of state when manipulating it. shouldComponentUpdate() compares the pointers to these arrays, thus, had we edited the 	  same array, the pointer would have remained the same and comparision would always be true! LECTURE NO: 93
  React.memo(component) does the same work in functional components  

- PureComponent: doesn't run any life cycle hook if any property is unchanged => Use instead of shouldComponentUpdate()

- Adjacent jsx are returned 
	1) In an array with a unique id
	2) aux
	3) React.fragment
	4) WithClass hoc
	5) withClass function returning a hoc
	***	HOC: write some HTML/CSS/JS for us behind the scenes(wrappers) 

- AuthContext API: used to pass objects or states among diff components, without needing pass the data via props
				   The JSX components which need it are wrapped inside (consumer & provider). 
				   In consuming, we return a fn which gets a context argument by default.
				   contexType is used for class based & useContext for functional components, when we want to use it outside of JSX code











				   ----------------------------BURGER BUILDER-----------------------------------

- Folder structure: components folder => stateless components, containers folder => stateful components
- Used Aux for giving a wrapping div to return adjacent JSX elements
- Images in Webpack? How it handles, optimises and stores them? - lecture 169
- CSS modules makes it possible => wrapping logo inside a div for controlling it's height in diff components - 172
- use lifecycle hook for modal component as it need not be rendered each time
- JSON placeholder typeicode
- interceptors: we can intercept errors of axios and show some UI(modal) to the user

- Class based component is prefered over functional component if :-
	1. we need to manage state using setState(without useState/hooks)
	2. we need to use component life cycle methods

- Routing: turns ReactJS from component making library to a framework
