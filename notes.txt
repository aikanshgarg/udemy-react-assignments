- JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. 
	*It converts components to JS syntax by using the import React and it's createElement() method. 

- React has a VIRTUAL DOM which it compares with current dom to see what should it render, compares present with future.

- We can't write block statements like if-else in rendering the elements to DOM in JSX. Use ternary( ? : ) operator instead. 

- Rendering Lists: map() method is used to render a list for mapping a JS array with JSX elements array, and render them accordingly.
  'key' is required property of list items in React.

- 'Radium': to use CSS properties like pseduo selectors (:hover) and media queries inside .js files(JSX)
   Useful for dynamically changing styles or scoping them to a particular component
   'StyleRoot' component for using transformation selectors like media query and keyframes
